 Always write Java code.
✅ Code must read input from the user.
✅ No comment lines in the code.
✅ If the code is small, no separate functions.
✅ Mention time complexity of each code.
✅ Don’t use camelCase in code.
✅ Give at least 2–3 approaches — start with naive, then better(if any), then best — comparing time and space complexity.
✅ Trace the approaches neatley with a sample test case step by step as per the given code and also visually show diagram if possible for that particular question for a better understanding.
